If you want to customise your experience, then simply edit the values in config.txt.

Recommended:
Image:          world_map_full.png [Put a pic in the res/Maps/ folder, must be green and blue]
Reproduction:   8  [This is the threshold of reproduction, lower = higher birthrate]
Colonies:       10 [This is the number of colonies the simulation begins with]
PLEASE NOTE, setting the colony count too high can cause CRASHES, hence it will check your number, and change it if you set it too high!


Controls:

    WASD -> Pan Camera
    Up/Down -> Zoom in/ out

Custom Colonies
    You must change the value in config.txt CUSTOM_START from 0 to 1
    You must have a corresponding file for the image in the res/Starts/ folder with the following format for each colony:

------------------------------------
    COLONY
    START
    x y

    STRENGTH
    low high

    PEOPLE
    n

    COLOUR
    r g b
    END
------------------------------------

    Where:
        START       refers to the start point of the colony
        STRENGTH    refers to the range of strength values for the colony's pioneers
        PEOPLE      refers to how many people the colony starts with
        COLOUR      refers to the RGB colour values of the colony

For an example, view res/Starts/world_map.txt
